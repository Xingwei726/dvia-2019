## Concept 1 / Basic Clock

Similar to a sand clock, each day starts with a fully colored 12*12 square, for each second/minute/hour lost in ‘time’, one unit will be recolored to white. By end of the day, we will get no 'time' left but a white square.

## Concept 2 / Beating Dots

Overlapping each circle on top of each other, as time proceeds forward each arc starts to complete their own cycle and return to the starting point.

## Concept 3 / Blocks

Hour/minute/second all represented by a block, they all started at left margin of the canvas. As time procedding, each of them moves one relative unit towards right, by the end of each cycle they reach the right margin of the canvas. In this clock, x-coordinate and width of the block represents time unit.
