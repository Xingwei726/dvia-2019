            The largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations (in degrees). In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated horizontal position of the earthquake. Earthquake locations in which the azimuthal gap exceeds 180 degrees typically have large location and depth uncertainties.

                Holmes and Watson's investigations take them across London. Sherlock
                deduces that West was murdered elsewhere, then moved to Aldgate
                Station to create the illusion that he was crushed on the tracks by
                a train. On their way to Woolwich Sherlock dispatches a telegram to
                Mycroft at London Bridge: "Send list of all foreign spies known to
                be in England, with full address."

            <h3>Largest Gap</h3>
            <p>
                While investigating at Woolwich Arsenal Sherlock learns that West
                did not have the three keys&mdash;door, office, and
                safe&mdash;necessary to steal the papers. The train station clerk
                mentions seeing an agitated West boarding the 8:15 train to London
                Bridge. Sherlock suspects West of following someone who had access
                to the Woolwich chief's keyring with all three keys.

                Mycroft responds to Sherlock's telegram and mentions several spies.
                Hugo Oberstein of 13 Caulfield Gardens catches Sherlock's eye. He
                heads to the nearby Gloucester Road station to investigate and
                learns that the windows of Caulfield Gardens open over rail tracks
                where trains stop frequently.

                Holmes deduces that the murderer placed West atop a stopped train at
                Caulfield Gardens. The train traveled to Aldgate Station before
                West's body finally toppled off. Backtracking to the criminal's
                apartment, Holmes finds a series of classified ads from
                <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> stashed away. All are under the name
                Pierrot: "Monday night after nine. Two taps. Only ourselves. Do not
                be so suspicious. Payment in hard cash when goods delivered."
